						<h2><strong>Teaching & Outreach</strong></h2>
						<p>I believe part of being an effective scientist is sharing your knowledge with others through
						<br />
						outreach, mentorship, promoting equity, and by expressing an openness to share analyses and data
						<br />
						whenever possible. As a first-generation student in college, I experienced barriers, bumps, and  
						<br />
						detours along my path into the world of ecology. Having overcome these obstacles, I credit both
						<br />
						the  many people who took time to mentor me along the way and, of course, the researchers who 
						<br />
						make their data and analyses publicly available, effectively creating opportunities for hands-on 
						<br />
						learning for students. These experiences are why I prioritize being available to the students     
						<br />
						that I teach for professional mentorship (e.g., reading cover letters and CVs), leading workshops
						<br />
						ranging from DNA extractions for microbiome research, to training in R and other statistical software.
						<br />
						 Because I see the value and the utility of open-source data and analyses in ecology, I make the data
						<br />
						 and code of published manuscripts I am involved in available <a href="https://github.com/sjgillman">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> 
						<br />
						to promote analytical transparency, reproducability, and collaboration.</p>

													<h3><strong>Principles of Ecology Lab: BI 210L</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Teaching Assistant, Biology Department, Northern Michigan University 2018-2019</strong></>
												<p>As a teaching assistant for the Principles of Ecology lab, I was also involved in course development for each of the labs. I had the opportunity to introduce undergraduate students to a variety of concepts including ecological succession, conducting laboratory and field research, scientific reading & writing, as well as teaching students to identify the local flora and fauna.</p>

												<p><strong>Teaching Assistant, Biology Department, Florida State University 2012-2013</strong></p>
												<p>During my junior and senior years of undergradate school, I was one of five taching assistants for a class of 400. My role as a teaching assistant was to answer any questions during the lectures, hold office hours to tutor students on topic ranging from human reproduction to archaeology, grade, and hold presentations and reviews for exams.</p>

												</header>
												<p><strong>Undergraduate and graduate workshops, Northern Michigan University, 2019 & 2020</strong></p>
												<p>As part of my masters, I trained undergraduates and new graduates in the proper protocols required for microbial DNA extractions using DNeasy PowerSoil kits. This allowed undergraduates to undertake supervised research and ensured new graduate students were prepared for their research projects.</p>
												<p>In addition to training students in labratory protocols, I provided tutorials on the bioinformatic and analytical pipeline for wildlife microbial research in QIIME2, GALAXY, and R.

													<h3><strong>Outreach</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Wildlife & Research Presenter</strong></>
												<p>I have actively been involved in conservation programs outreach efforts during my internship, school, and jobs. As a zookeeper, I served as an ambassador cheetah trainer and presenter for 1.5 years. I travelled up and down the west coast of the US visiting schools, conferences, and fundraisers, speaking to the public about the plight of large carnivores. During my M.S., I presented my research to middle and high schoolers.</p>
