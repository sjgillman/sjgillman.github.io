						<h2><strong>Teaching & Outreach</strong></h2>
						<br />
						<p>I believe part of being an effective scientist is sharing your knowledge with 
						<br />
						others through outreach, mentorship, and an openness with analyzes and data whenever possible.
						<br />
						As a first-generation student in college, there were mistakes, bumps, and detours along my path
						<br />
						into the world of ecology. I credit the many people who took the time to mentor me along the way
						<br />
						and of course the many people who make understanding analyze, through online tutorials, accessible
						<br />
						to new students. That is why I prioritize being available to students that I teach by pointing them
						<br />
						to different sources to find jobs, reading cover letters and CVs, and workshops ranging from DNA
						<br />
						extractions for microbiome research, to training them in R and other statistical software. Additionally,
						<br />
						because I see and value the potential advancement open-source data can bring to ecology, I ensure all
						<br />
						data and scripts involved in published manuscripts and tutorials I make for students are available on
						<br /> 
						platforms such as <a href="https://github.com/sjgillman">GitHub</a><a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>.</p>

												<p>Teaching Assistant, Biology Department, Florida State University 2012-2013</p>
												<p>During my junior and senior years of undergradate school, I was one of five taching assistants for a class of 400. My role as a teaching assistant was to answer any questions during the lectures, hold office hours to tutor students on topic ranging from human reproduction to archaeology, grade, and hold presentations and reviews for exams.</p>

													<h3>Workshops: DNA Extraction and Statistical Analysis for Microbiome Research</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Undergraduate and graduate workshops, Northern Michigan University, 2019 & 2020</p>
												<p>As part of my masters, I trained undergraduates and new graduates in the proper protocols required for microbial DNA extractions using DNeasy PowerSoil kits. This allowed undergraduates to undertake supervised research and ensured new graduate students were prepared for their research projects.</p>
												<p>In addition to training students in labratory protocols, I provided tutorials on the bioinformatic and analytical pipeline for wildlife microbial research in QIIME2, GALAXY, and R.
