									<p>With Puget Sound being the second largest estuary in the US 
										with a wide range of habitats, nutrient rich waters, 
										diverse wildlife, and expansive shoreline, its 
										ecological and economic importance to Washington is unparalleled.
										With an increase in human activities, extreme weather events and the 
										continued decline of many marine mammal and seabird populations, continued work that 
										applies research to support conservation and management is critical to marine ecosystems. 
										For my dissertation, I am 
										working in collaboration with Washington Department of Fish and 
										Wildlife to build Wall-to-wall predicted 
										density surfaces for marine bird species in US portion 
										of the Salish Sea with the use of hierarchical distance 
										models to create maps depicting marine bird and mammal 
										densities by season to help identify hots-spots, cold-spots and 
										intermittent cold/hot-spots of community density. I am further aiming to aiming 
										to conduct population viability analysis for Marbled Murrelet in the Salish Sea.</p>

									<p>The microorganisms living on and within an animal host 
										(collectively known as the microbiome) play critical 
										roles in host health. Symbiotic microorganism found 
										in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) constitute the gut microbiome (GMB) and 
										contribute to nutrient uptake and immune
										system maintenance. In the past, GMB research 
										typically focused on microbial communities 
										associated with the colon, where fiber 
										fermentation occurs and noninvasive samples 
										are easily obtained (i.e., feces). However, 
										in omnivores and carnivores, nearly 90% of nutrients 
										including fats and proteins are absorbed in the jejunum, 
										the middle section of the small intestine. With vastly 
										different digestive processes occurring in the jejunum 
										and colon, GMB membership and diversity (i.e., 
										richness and evenness) are hypothesized to differ 
										between these two regions of the GIT. Yet, functional 
										differences between jejunum and colon microbial communities 
										in most non-model species have yet to be explored. 
										American black bears (<span class="emphasized">Ursus americanus</span>) retain the short, 
										simple colons. For my first chapter, 
										I compared the microbial taxa comprising GMBs in 
										two operationally distinct regions of the GIT (i.e., 
										jejunum and colon) of wild American black bear 
										from harvested specimen from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
										The we found that the microbial communities of 
										jejunum and colon of black bears did not were different <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77282-w">(Gillman et al., 2020)</a>.

										<br />
										The GMB diversity and community composition in mammals is influenced 
										by a variety of factors (e.g., habitat, sex) with diet being 
										identified as a primary driver of mammalian GMB structure 
										and function. Human-mediated perturbations to natural 
										food webs may shift and uncouple the co-evolved 
										relationships between mammals and their microbes 
										with consequences to health. As common carnivore 
										that is widely distributed, has a broad diet, and 
										can be legally harvested over human-provisioned 
										foods (i.e., bait), black bears are an excellent model to 
										investigate the impact of food web perturbations on the 
										gut microbiome of a wild carnivore.
										For the second chapter 
										of my masters, investigated whether human-provisioned foods 
										(e.g., confectionaries, dog food), which are found throughout 
										the landscape due to the use of baits during the hunting season, 
										reduced GMB diversity. I subsequently used a combination of 16S rRNA 
										sequencing (microbiome) and stable isotope analysis (diet) 
										to examine how the proportional contribution of human-provisioned 
										foods to the diet of black bears affected their gut microbiomes 
										and found a distinct reduction in microbial diversity in bears 
										that consumed higher proportions of human-provisioned foods
										<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jmammal/gyab154/6483967?login=true">(Gillman et al., 2021)</a>. By teaming up with hunters, guides, and wildlife managers, 
										we were able to acquire samples from operationally distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract of legally 
										harvested bears to examine whether the impacts of human-provisioned foods differentially affect microbial communities 
										along the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
