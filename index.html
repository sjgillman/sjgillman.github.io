						<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
						
						<p>I’m Sierra Gillman, a Ph.D. Student, National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate  
							
							Research Fellow, and Achievement Reward for College Scientists (ARCS) Scholar in
							
							Dr. Beth Gardner’s Quantitative Ecology Lab located in the School of Environmental 
							
							and Forest Sciences at the University of Washington. I am interested on working to develop
							
							our understanding of wildlife’s responses to global environmental change by studying long-term
							
							 species monitoring, population dynamics, and distribution patterns using quantitative techniques
						
							to model the response of wildlife populations to anthropogenic stressors.
							<br />
							I received my B.S. in Biology and Environmental Studies (<span class="emphasized">double major</span>) from Florida State
							
							 University in 2013 and my M.S. in Biology in 2020 from Northern Michigan University in 
							
							Dr. Diana Lafferty’s Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Science Lab where I studied the gut
							
							microbiome of wild American black bears. During my M.S., I worked on collaborative projects focused 
							
							on understanding the potential ramifications of anthropogenic pressures on wildlife gut microbiomes (GMBs),
							
							including investigating the impacts of human-provisioned foods on wild black bear GMBs diversity  
							
							(M.S. chapter), habitat fragmentation on American marten GMBs, and long-term radiation exposure to wild 
							boar GMBs inhabiting the Fukushima Nuclear Exclusion Zone.</p>

											<br />
										At Starkey Experimental Forest, I was a technician for a collaborative project between OSU and ODFW 
											working for a project focused on interactions between four carnivores 
											present in the area (cougars, coyotes, bobcats, and bears), and additionally their 
											influences on prey populations. Part of my role there was deploying and helping to 
											maintain camera trap grids, assisting in captures, and collaring of the four 
											carnivores, and tracking collared individuals.</p>

											As a technician in the Wild Herbivore Ecology Lab, I worked for a focused the

												      deer in northeastern WA. In this role I collected forestry and vegetation data, 
												      including performing dbh, canopy height, boring for age, vegetation collection and 
												      identification, built temporary pens for hand raised deer, behavioral observations, while spending 9 days at a time camping.</p>

											In the Menebe region of Madagascar, I worked in western site. Dr. Merson’s was investigating the anthropogenic 
											threats facing Madagascar’s largest carnivore, the fosa by examining socio-economic, and geographic. Dr. Merson also studied 
											the effects of habitat disturbance and exotic species presence on the spatio-temporal occurrence of 
											fosa through large-scale camera-trapping in forests. In my role, I help establish and maintain camera 
											trap grids to monitor fosa, assisted in surveying local communities to better understand human-fosa 
											conflict, and scheduled traveling from site to site</p>

											For this project, MBP 
											implemented non-invasive techniques that rely on fecal samples as source of DNA. During my 
											role as a field technician, I spent 5 days a week conducting focal studies to monitor behavior, 
											activity, and diet of the lemurs in the area. I also collected fecal samples for DNA analysis, 
											worked with local guides, and ran the day-to-day logistics on site for the project.</p>

							As a carnivore keeper for WSP’s cheetah breeding program, 
								which is part of the Association of Zoo and Aquarium’s Species Survival Plan, I focused not only on the care 
								of cheetahs and other large carnivores, but also studied cheetah breeding behavior, participated in artificial 
								insemination projects, raised and monitored abandon cubs, and conducted outreach across the Pacific Northwest 
								with ambassador cheetahs. It was here while monitoring the breeding behavior that I realized I wanted to 
								continue down the path of wildlife research and ultimately lead me to where I am today.</p>
